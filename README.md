# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains separate tasks labeled from 1 to 5, addressing distinct analyses related to the Collatz conjecture, penguins dataset, entropy, and an independent Iris dataset project.

## Requirements:

Python 3.11.4 or later
Jupyter Notebooks (detailed below)
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn (imports detailed in notebook)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nexlanglxm/fundamentals-of-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Open the folder using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code(with Jupyter support installed)
3. **Navigate to the Specific Task:**
   - For Tasks:
   Access the `tasks.ipynb` file.
   - For Iris Dataset Project: Open and explore the `project.ipynb` file.

## Task 1: Collatz Conjecture Verification

### Problem Description

The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you always get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . . 

### Task Description

Verify, using Python, that the Collatz conjecture holds true for the first 10,000 positive integers.

## Task 2: Penguins Dataset Overview

### Task

Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model them in Python, explaining your rationale.

## Task 3: Penguins Probability Distribution

### Task

For each variable in the penguin data set, suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distribution list is the most appropriate to model the variable.

## Task 4: Coin Flip Entropy

### Task

Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability ***p*** of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus ***p***.

## Task 5:  Plots for Penguins

### Task

Create an appropriate individual plot for each of the variables in the penguin data set.

## PROJECT - Iris Dataset Analysis

### Overview

An independent project focusing on exploring and analyzing the well-known Iris flower dataset associated with Ronald A Fisher.

#### Project Sections

- **Loading and Understanding the Dataset:** Covers basic information about the Iris dataset.
- **Variables Types and Scales of Measurement:** Discusses the classification of variables based on types and scales of measurement.
- **Summary Statistics for Each Variable:** Demonstrates and explains appropriate summary statistics for understanding the dataset.
- **Plots for Each Variable:** Illustrates suitable visualizations for each variable within the Iris dataset.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizes key findings and insights from the Iris dataset exploration.
